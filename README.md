Setup process for my Magic Mirror

# Following the instructions from MagicMirror^2
 - Started here:  https://docs.magicmirror.builders/getting-started/installation.html
 - Which pointed me towards sdetweil's MagicMirror setup script: https://github.com/sdetweil/MagicMirror_scripts

Ran the following code from github.com/sdetweil/MagicMirror_scripts:

```bash
bash -c  "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdetweil/MagicMirror_scripts/master/raspberry.sh)"
```

During the install process, two questions were asked and I said 'y' to both:
 - Do you want to disable the screen saver?
 - Do you want use pm2 for auto starting of your MagicMirror

Upon completion, it printed this message:<br>
We're ready! Run pm2 start MagicMirror from the ~/MagicMirror directory to start your MagicMirror.

<b>CURRENT STEP</b>:  Then installed a MagicMirror module manager:
